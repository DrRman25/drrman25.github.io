            <h1>Setting Up a Minecraft Server</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my text-based tutorial on setting up a Minecraft server. This server is going to be completely vanilla, meaning you can't install any plugins or mods.</p>
            <h2>Things to Do Beforehand</h2>
            <p>Before you get started with this tutorial, you need to, obviously, have a desktop or laptop that meets the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/get-minecraft#features2"><em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> system requirements</a>, and you need to <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/get-minecraft">buy Minecraft</a> for $29.99. This will grant you access to both <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. However, you only need <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> for this tutorial, which is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows.</p>
            <p>You will also need to <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17">install Java 17</a>, which is compatible with <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> 1.19.2, the latest version. If you have other version(s) of Java installed, uninstall ALL of them, and install Java 17.</p>
            <h2>The Server <code style="font-size: 87.5%;">.jar</code> File</h2>
            <p>The reason why you need to install Java 17 is because you need to be able to run the server <code>.jar</code> file, which should be named something like <code>minecraft_server.1.19.2.jar</code>. You can <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/download/server">download it on the Minecraft website</a>.</p>
            <p>Once you have downloaded the file, create a new folder (preferably on your desktop for ease of access), and name it whatever you want. After that, put the <code>.jar</code> file in your folder, and double-click on it with your primary mouse button. It should create a bunch of files, and then say "Press any key to continue".</p>
