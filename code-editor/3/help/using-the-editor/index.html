            <h1>Using the Editor</h1>
            <p>This page provides a basic tutorial on using the <a href="../../languages/html-css-js/" target="_blank">HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a> editor. However, editors for different languages have similar, if not the same, features.</p>
            <h2>The Editor Interface</h2>
            <p>There are several buttons above the editor, which do different things. They will be mentioned again in a later section. For now, let's look at the editor itself.</p>
            <p>There are two sections of the editor's interface currently. The first one is the area where you type in code you want to run live. The second one is the output area, where you actually see the output, after you click or tap the "Run" button or press "Ctrl-Enter" on your keyboard.</p>
            <p>If you have a wide screen (a screen width greater than or equal to 1200px), both the text editor and the output area will always be present on the left and right sides of the screen, respectively. If you have a narrow screen (a screen width less than 1200px), there will be buttons at the top right to switch between the text editor and the output area. If you don't know what your screen width is, use the button below to display it in a tooltip.</p>
            <button id="screen-width" aria-title="Check screen width" class="control">Check Screen Width</button>
            <h2>The Buttons</h2>
            <p>There are normally four buttons at the top left, which you can click or tap to perform certain actions.</p>
            <h3>Run</h3>
            <p>The first button, labeled by "Run", takes the code you typed into the text editor, interprets it, and shows the output. However, there is a 500-millisecond cooldown for this button, to prevent spamming.</p>
            <h3>Share</h3>
            <p>This next button, labeled by "Share", opens a menu, where you can get a link to your program, or download the code to your computer.</p>
            <h3>Save</h3>
            <p>The third button, labeled by "Save", allows you to save your program to <a href="../../languages/my-programs/">My Programs</a>, a place designated for storing your valuable code.</p>
            <h3>Clear Output</h3>
            <p>The fourth button, labeled by "Clear Output", clears the output for you. This is useful in cases where you run the code, and it gets a little too hectic, or the program uses up too many of your computer's resources.</p>
            <h2>Running Some Code</h2>
            <p>Either write your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, or use the below template.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-html"><span class="tok-meta">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="tok-angleBracket">&lt;</span><span class="tok-typeName">html</span><span class="tok-angleBracket">&gt;</span>

            <p>If you used the above code, you should see the following:</p>
            <iframe id="frame-1" style="background-color: white; border: none; width: 100%; height: 25rem;"></iframe>
        </article>
        <script defer="true" src="script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
